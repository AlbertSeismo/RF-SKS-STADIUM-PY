## Installation
#Install the environment `rfsksenv` by running the following command (Note: It requires preinstalled anaconda)


#### For OSX:
```conda env create -f environment_osx_10_14_6.yml```

#### For Linux:
```conda env create -f environment_UbuntuXIX.yml```

#### Then:
```conda activate rfsksenv```

#### If having some issues with Cartopy, one simple fix may be:
```pip uninstall shapely; pip install --no-binary :all: shapely```


## Run:
```python main.py```

### User's input:
Most of the code is automated. However, several parameters need to be set by the user.
Those are defined in "input_parameters.txt".
Below, you will find a list of the parameters, with possible values and description.

The other parameters are defined in the code and should be modified with caution by the users.

### Procedure:

* Search the events that satisfy some critera (defined input_parameters.txt).

* Search all stations for which data are available (defined input_parameters.txt).

* Download the waveforms.

* This is an automated procedure that may be time consuming if a large dataset is selected.


## Process the data following:

### RF
- Filter and rotate the trace into the LQ domain.
- Deconvolve the radial and tangential components by the vertical component.
- Calculate the piercing points for each event.
- Stacks the reciever functions before plotting.
- Plot the reciever functions for L and Q components, sorted by back azimuth (or distance).
- Create some vertical profile for all stations in selected regions.

### SKS
- Filter and rotate the trace into the radial/tangential referencial.
- Minimize the energy on the transverse components.
- Automatically pick the SKS phase.
- Invert for phase and delay time.
- Plot the results.
